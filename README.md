# TicTacToe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple game played on a 3x3 grid. Two players take turns marking spaces with "X" or "O" until one player gets three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or all spaces are filled, resulting in a draw. The player who succeeds in creating a row of three of their marks is declared the winner.
