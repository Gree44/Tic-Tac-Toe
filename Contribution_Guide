# Contribution Guide

Thank you for your interst in contributing to our Open-Source-Project Tic-Tac-Toe!
Through user assitance from developers like you, we are able to grow and improve our software. Therefore benefitting the whole user community.
Please take a little bit of time reading this guide. It will make sure you get a smooth and pleasing experience contributing to our Project.

## 1. Setting up your work enviroment.
    First, you'll need to fork our repository so you can make your changes without affecting the main codebase. Here are the steps:
      - Fork the project repository to your own personal GitHub account.
      - Clone the fork to your machine locally.
      - Create a git branch on which you'll work on your bug fix or feature.

    Remember to regularly pull changes from the upstream repository to keep your local repository up to date.

2. Making Changes to the Project
    If you are commited to making a change, please discuss your plans with the owners of this repository.
    You can do this by communicating via e-mail, issue or any other method of your liking as long as the owners can be reached via those methods.
    It would be a pity if you spend a lot of time working on a change, which will not make it into the project.

    If you have communicated with the owners and you are ready to make the changes, please pay close attention to the following rules:
      - Make sure to write clear meaningful commit messages.
      - Make sure your changes are well-tested.
      - Ensure your code follows the existing style of the project to make it easier for others to understand. (Remember, if you are not able to understand your code, why should anyone else be?)

3. Submitting your code via a pull request
  If you decide your code is ready to be merged into the project, please follow the following steps.
    - Push your local branch to your forked copy of the repository.
    - From your forked repository, submit a Pull Request (PR) to the main repository.
    - In the PR submission description, please include as many details as possible and reference any issues related to your PR.

  If you submit your code it can take a while until your code gets either merged into the project or the maintainers of the project might reach out to you asking for clarafication or changes.
  Therefore please be available to collaborate further on your code until ist fully merged.

Finally:
Thank you for your contributions to our projects! 
We greatly appreciate your hardwork in order to improve our Open-Source-Project and are more than happy to have you as part of our community!
